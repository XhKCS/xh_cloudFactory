I am a freshman who has just learned iava for three months, and this is a simple cloud-factory system, which uses java swing on eclipse IDE. 
Actually, It is a homework from one of my school tasks.
It is simple, but it has comlplete functions and basic UI interface, and I think it may do help to some students and beginners like me.
I will be very happy if my simple work can be recognized or do help to someone! 
Welcome for advice, comments or introduction!
